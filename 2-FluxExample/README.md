# Flux example app
Build on top of [react-hot-load-webpack-boilerplate](https://github.com/jackfranklin/react-hot-load-webpack-boilerplate).

This example uses the Flux implementation [Alt](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt). Alt was chosen because of it self-proclaims pure Flux, which would then contrast with Redux.

## How to run
1. First install the dependencies with `npm install`
2. Then start the app by using `node dev-server.js`
3. Open the browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
4. Profit
