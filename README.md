# React Presentation
This repository contains a presentation I worked on during my spare time, in order to present a bit of the [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) ecosystem to some work colleagues.

I introduced the basic concepts of [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/), also speaking a bit about [react-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) and the amazingly useful [Redux DevTools (Chrome extension)](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension).

## Where is the presentation?
It is quite a simple presentation, as overloaded slides tend to distract the attendees, but feel free to have a look at it, if you want. To do so:

1. Build the React app
2. Build and run the presentation
3. Enjoy

## The reason behind it
The purpose of this presentation was to put on practise my knowledge about these tools, while presenting them to workmates that did not know much, if anything, about them.
In my opinion, React would be a very good candidate to replace the frankenframework we have in a purely VanillaJS SPA, so this presentation was also used to defend that point.

##Some considerations
- Even though I had read a lot about React, I had watched multiple talks, I had attended multiple React meetups in London, and I even went to the ReactEurope Conference of the year, **this was my very first time actually coding in React**. Because of that, **there may be bad practices** that I have used without knowing them. Apologies if that is the case. Feedback would be welcome.
- It is not difficult to see that there are no unit tests for the code. That is not something I am proud of, as I think that they are as important as the rest of the code, if not more, but I was short in time and I had to make some sacrifices.
- I avoided [CSS in JS](http://blog.vjeux.com/2014/javascript/react-css-in-js-nationjs.html) and [CSS modules](https://github.com/gajus/react-css-modules) on purpose. I wanted to focus on the JS for this presentation, so I used common CSS files in it.
- The example app(s) do not look extremely nice. One of the reasons for that is that I removed all that code that could be legally property of the company. Sorry if the final result is a bit dull.
 
## Tools used
As mentioned, this was my first dive in a _"real"_ React application, so I didn't want to spend too much time with the setup. For that reason, to build the applications I used [Jack Franklin](https://twitter.com/jack_franklin)'s [react-hot-load-webpack-boilerplate](https://github.com/jackfranklin/react-hot-load-webpack-boilerplate). Thanks Jack, really useful. I owe you one.

On the other hand, for the presentation I used [Spectacle Boilerplate](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle-boilerplate), because, is there any better way of presenting a library than using it to build its own presentation?

## Feedback welcome
I love how React works and I really enjoy learning about it, even if I have not managed (yet) to use it on an everyday basis. If checking the code you spot any tremendous mistake, I would really appreciate to be told.

Nonetheless, thank you and enjoy!
